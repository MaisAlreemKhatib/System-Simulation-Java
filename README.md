This project is a Java-based Space Simulation developed as part of a programming course. The application models a simple universe environment that includes:

Planets (Gezegen.java)

Spacecrafts (UzayAraci.java)

People/Characters (Kisi.java)

Time flow (Zaman.java)

The simulation uses external data files (Gezegenler.txt, Araclar.txt, Kisiler.txt) to initialize objects such as planets, vehicles, and individuals. Core functionality is handled by the Simulasyon.java class, which controls interactions, timing, and events in the virtual space.

Key Features:

Object-oriented design (classes for planets, people, vehicles, and time)

File reading and parsing via DosyaOkuma.java

Simulation of planetary and spacecraft interactions

Modular and extendable structure for future enhancements

The project is packaged as a runnable JAR file (simulasyon.jar) and can be executed to demonstrate the simulation in action. It provides students with hands-on experience in Java programming, OOP concepts, and simulation modeling.
